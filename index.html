	I was in computer science when i came up with the idea for a blog, Mr. Juranich had talked abouit are project to create a website.
  I was intreged, at first i thought i could use ome javascript to make an interactive website, but then i thought about it and swiftly relised that would be to much work
  so i set out ot mak the dankest blog ever and heres how it turned out.
