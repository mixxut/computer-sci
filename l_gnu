  <h2>The joys of linux/GNU</h2>

<p>"it works on pc, mac and Linux" is somthing you may hear when somone is talking about an apllication they use or one you will be using, but many people have no clue what they are talking about when the say linux. 
They know pc means the most current version of windows and mac means apples newest ios but linux is lost on them. That was me until about ninth grade when I truely started to understand what linux/GNU was;
And so during the last days before winter brake my friend jacob aided in instaling ubuntu (a popular linux/GNU distrabution) on to my Macbook air. 
I had winter brake to become familler with linux/GNU, and in that time I found many things I enjoyed about Linux/GNU. </p>
